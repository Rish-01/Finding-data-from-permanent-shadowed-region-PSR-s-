# Finding-data-from-permanent-shadowed-region-PSR-s-

There have been permanently shadowed regions(PSR's) on the lunar surface as sunlight can't reach that region. Since the birth of the moon the sunlight hasn't reached that place and there is a possibility that frozen ice can be found from that region. This regions are on the South pole of the lunar surface which haven't been explored by any rover physically. ISRO's Chandrayaan-2 aimed to visit those places but wasn't successful in it. But the images captured by the camera known as the [OHRC images][ohrc] are very precise and tell about the lunar surface of various places on the south pole.

### Task
- The task is simple to find data in the PSR's by processing the data 

### Knowledge Required
- Python
- Python libraries(numpy,pandas,matplotlib, etc)
- OpenCV
- Machine learning
- Deep Learning
- Image Processing

Something sort of [this][ben] needs to be done on the OHRC images. [This][ben] work has been done on the NAC images by NASA which are different from OHRC images on the aspects of illumination and different kind of noise in it.
